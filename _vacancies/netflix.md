challenge: |
  Netflix is the world’s leading Internet television network. The company works hard to provide its partners and consumers with information at a fast pace. One of the ways Netflix does this is by ensuring informational websites stay up to date with relevant and engaging content.

  Maintaining sites such as [Netflix Devices](https://devices.netflix.com) was a difficult process. Existing solutions were inflexible in the kind of edits they allowed. The Netflix Partner Marketing team struggled to make the edits they needed, often requiring help from developers. Netflix Partner Marketing needed an innovative, fast paced way of creating and maintaining these sites to empower marketers and free up developer time.
solution: |
  Netflix partnered with CloudCannon to rebuild [Netflix Devices](https://devices.netflix.com). Devices was originally a Drupal site and was rebuilt in a fraction of the time using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). The site is static so it loads quickly and reliably scales to the millions of Netflix visitors.

  The Partner Marketing team have taken control of their site. They're empowered to quickly try out new messaging and update content directly on the page.
